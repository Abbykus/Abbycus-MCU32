# Abbycus MCU32
### A low cost - high performance 32 bit MicroController module with complete DIY development environment. ###
### What is the MCU32 module? ###
The IOX-2.0 module is a 32 bit / 48 MHz MicroController Unit (MCU) utilizing the STMicroelectronics STM32F030K6. The IOX-2.0 module embeds the MCU, a precision crystal resonator, signal biasing, and power filtering on a small 1.5cm square board which can be surface mounted to a PCB, connected via header pins, or hardwired to your projects hardware.
The MCU32 module is capable of many advanced I/O functions, servo control outputs, digital pulse width and frequency measurements, a fast 12-bit ADC with up to 10 multiplexed channels, rotatry encoder support, high speed serial buses (I2C, UART, SPI), and much more.
### How can I program and debug the MCU32? ###
The module is paired with the Abbycus IOX-BREAKOUT board featuring a pogo pin socket which routes signals to 0.1" header pins and connectors for the various serial bus options. The breakout board also contains connection for the STMicroelectronics ST-LINK V2 programmer and debug tool. 
The MCU32, IOX-Breakout board, and the ST-LINK V2 programmer work with the [STMCubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) free software to enable the user to program and debug C/C++ code for the MCU.
The pogo pin socket allows rapid development and gang programming of the MCU32 module without mounting or soldering. See also the Quick Start PDF file in the DOC directory.
