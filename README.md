# IOX-2.0
### A 32 bit MicroController module with a complete DIY programming environment. ###
### What is the IOX-2.0 module? ###
The IOX-2.0 module is a 32 bit / 48 MHz MicroController Unit (MCU) utilizing the STMicroelectronics STM32F030K6. The IOX-2.0 module embeds the MCU, a precision crystal resonator, signal biasing, and power filtering on a small 1.5cm square board which can be surface mounted to a PCB, connected via header pins, or hardwired to your projects hardware.
The module is capable of many advanced I/O functions, servo control outputs, digital pulse width and frequency measurements, a fast 12-bit ADC with up to 10 multiplexed channels, rotatry encoder support, high speed serial buses (I2C, UART, SPI), and much more.
### How can I program and debug the IOX-2.0? ###
The module can be paired with the Abbycus IOX Breakout board which features a pogo pin socket which routes signals to 0.1" header pins and connectors for the various serial bus configurations. The breakout board also contains connection for the STMicroelectronics ST-LINK V2 programmer and debug tool. 
The IOX-2.0, IOX-Breakout board, and the ST-LINK V2 programmer work with the [STMCubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) free software to enable the user to program and debug C/C++ code for the MCU.
