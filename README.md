# IOX-2.0
### A 32 bit MicroController module with a complete DIY programming environment. ###
### What is the IOX-2.0 module? ###
The IOX-2.0 module is a 32 bit / 48 MHz MicroController Unit (MCU) based on the STMicroelectronics STM32F030K6. The IOX-2.0 module embeds the MCU, a precision crystal resonator, signal biasing, and power filtering on a small 1.5cm square board which can be surface mounted to a PCB, connected via header pins, or easily hardwired to your project.
The module is capable of many advanced I/O functions, servo control outputs, digital pulse width and frequency measurements, a fast 12-bit ADC with up to 10 multiplexed channels, rotatry encoder support, high speed serial buses (I2C, UART, SPI), and much more.
### How can I use the features of the IOX-2.0? ###
The module can be paired with the Abbycus IOX Breakout board which features a pogo pin socket routing signals to breakout header pins and various serial bus configurations. The breakout board also contains connection for the STMicroelectronics ST-LINK V2 programmer and debug tool.
